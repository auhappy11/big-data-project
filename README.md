# Big Data Project

The project was done as submission for course INFO-I 535, "Management, Access, and Use of Big and Complex Data." The individual project analyze hotel reviews dataset and create sentiment analyzer using logistic regression model. To implement the project, deployable database and cloud platforms were used to run queries, to process, and to create model in much faster speed despite of having large dataset. To employ the project following steps were taken:
1. Creating cluster using cloud platform MongoDB Atlas and ingesting noSQL data
2. Connecting to MongoDB using pymongo
3. Creating multiple databases to distribute the files
4. Processing and analyzing data using pySpark
5. Modelling sentiment analyzer using pySpark
6. Creating visualization using "chart" features in MongoDB Atlas.

The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and contains 515K hotel reviews. The project shows how to utilize suitable database and cloud platforms to manage big dataset.
